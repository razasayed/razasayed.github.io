<p>Hi there 👋, thanks for stopping by my own little corner of the Internet ! 🙂 .</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Raza Sayed, a software engineer located in Mumbai,India.Im passionate about building scalabale and robust systems and software with a keen eye towards maintainability and the overall product and user experience.</p>
<p>Im a polyglot engineer and i love using and learning about different programming languages/frameworks and techniques for becoming better at the craft of building, testing and shipping great software. I like writing code in imperative and functional style in languages like Ruby, Python, Go, Javascript and have also dabbled in functional programming using languages like Elixir and Scala.</p>
<p>I also have deep interest in cloud and open source and i like to get involved with designing and building scalable architectures using different cloud services that allows us to build and ship software reliably and efficiently to the end users.</p>
<p>Im fascinated by how technologies like containers, serverless and cloud native architectures have fundamentally changed the software development landscape by making it easier than ever to efficiently build, run and ship software ! 🚀.</p>
<p>Its also very interesting to see how AI and Machine Learning 🦾 are creating magical new applications and experiences for people all over the world and how the trend is shifting from software engineers programming specific instructions into machines for solving problems to programming learning algorithms into them that enable machines to learn by themselves how to solve a wide variety of new and challenging problems based on data.</p>
<p>Outside of work i enjoy reading 📖, learning more about technology 💻, hack on personal side projects 💡, watching movies 🍿 and travelling to interesting places 🏞 .</p>
